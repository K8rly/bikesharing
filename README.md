    Additional Visualizations
         - Showing a comparison of starting station coordinates versus ending station coordinates may be useful for investors. Depending on the geographical layout of Des Moines, this could help investors determine if additional effort would be needed to collect bikes from end stations and if riders would have access to enough bikes at their starting locations.
         - Examining a visualization with the age of riders and their starting or ending point could help investors implement additional features or safeguards for bikes and their riders.
